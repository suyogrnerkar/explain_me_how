Following ahead are is the piece of literature that explains and bolsters the understanding of the 'Art of computation' or for some picky ones 'Science of computation' in its crudest sense possible.


## Programming Languages. 
 - Provide a basic syntax/ways/tools to code or simply put for talking
   to computers.
 - Also provide some **Primitive Data Structures**, like arrays, hashes,
   etc.
 - As we advance further, we would use these basic tools and build
   upon them to make our own complex data structures. 
 - Why sould I care making new ones, Don't we have plenty of them
   already ?

 - Creating complex structures and programs means, more number of
   code statements to execute or more number of lines of code to 
   understand and process. That needs **Power**. 
 - Basically everything people do is to gain power or control over
   something in some sense and more power means more expense. 
 - Similarly even for a computer, more power means more cost to 
   operate. But, no one wants to pay more, so we squeeze that little
   machine sitting on your desk at its limits.
 - And to know the limits, we need to do some math. That's when 
   we need complexity analysis. To literally squeeze the machines.
-  That takes us to Next Topic : **Time Complexity Analysis**
